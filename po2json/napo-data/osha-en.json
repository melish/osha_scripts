This requires planning, implementation and monitoring by senior managers, risk assessment to identify hazards and risks, and the need to take appropriate action. It also requires appropriate behaviour from employees who should be properly trained and well supervised, and a cooperative approach so that risks are reduced and hazards are properly managed.<\/p>","september":"","show-next-day":"","show-next-month":"","show-next-week":"","show-next-year":"","show-previous-day":"","show-previous-month":"","show-previous-week":"","show-previous-year":"","sign-the-charter":"","description_napo-016-lungs-at-work":"Exposure to tobacco smoke is bad for both smokers’ and non-smokers’ health.

They promote OSH and lead by example; they are visible and aware of key issues. They are respected and trusted by the workforce because there is open communication and dialogue.

There are thirteen sketches. Each sketch concerns a working situation where Napo is confronted by the signs that come to life to teach him their meaning and the importance of safety. The sequences show what happens if the signs are not obeyed, and the technical and organisational obstacles against the efficient working of the signs.","Newsletter":"","occupational-safety-and-health-news-europe":"","brought-to-you-by-eu-osha":"","visit-us-at":"","subscribe-to-our":"","alert-service":"","for-customised-content-delivery":"","like-what-youre-reading":"","tell-a-colleague":"","description_napo_film_11":"<p>The film tells the story of Napo, a model workman.

It introduces changes to harmonise the signs (pictograms) used in the transport of dangerous goods and the signs used in product classification, labelling and packaging (CLP) of chemicals. The existing seven pictograms are to be replaced with nine.<\/p><p>The key dates are: 1 December 2010, when substances must be reclassified and labelled in line with the new global system (GHS); and 1 June 2015, when the same process will be applied to mixtures (formerly called preparations).<\/p><p>Napo is involved in a series of short sketches working with chemicals, including those that are irritants, flammable, corrosive, toxic or a danger to the environment. Each sketch is followed by a brief sequence showing how to prevent accidents by safe working practices. This film is suitable for all sectors and all levels of employees. The objective is to draw attention to the importance of labelling chemical products. After an explosive opening scene, six sequences show first the wrong way with the serious consequences then the right way by respecting the safety instructions. <\/p>","description_napo_film_13":"<p>The film raises awareness of the dangers of exposing the skin to harmful (and sometimes not so harmful) substances, the situations where exposures occur, and what can be done to avoid risks, protect the skin and prevent damage. Napo discovers many different situations where exposure to chemicals and other substances can cause skin problems. He learns about the amazing qualities of the skin, and strips naked to show the audience: ‘Everything you always wanted to know about... your skin’. He identifies measures to prevent problems and has three important messages: Avoid – Protect – Check.<\/p><p>Avoiding or minimising contact with chemicals is achieved through elimination - using a mechanical method instead of a chemical one; by substitution - using a safer alternative; and by employing a safe working distance - using tools rather than handling directly. Personal protective equipment (PPE) is designed to protect the skin but Napo reminds us of the importance of taking care of the skin by showing prompt removal of contamination, washing skin properly, drying skin thoroughly and applying skin creams regularly.Finally Napo recommends regular checks for early signs of skin problems. <\/p>","description_napo_film_14":"<p>Poor standards of maintenance are a major cause of accidents and occupational diseases. Many accidents happen during maintenance work, or because of lack of maintenance or as a result of poor quality maintenance.<\/p><p>This film shows Napo in a variety of situations; sometimes he is the maintenance worker, at other times he is an employee. We see the importance of isolating or ‘lock-off’ when maintenance is being carried out on machinery, the problems of ‘hidden hazards’, work in confined spaces, and the importance of competent persons carrying out maintenance work, particularly inspection and testing.<\/p> <p>This film, which is suitable for all sectors and all levels of employees, seeks to promote good practice and draws attention to the importance of safe maintenance. <\/p>","description_napo_film_2":"The film looks at common risks in the workplace and is ideal for young people who have little or no experience of work.

The film highlights the importance of accurately signposting risks, understanding warning labels, safety when traveling to and from work, the use of appropriate personal protective equipment, not taking risks, using the correct and most appropriate packaging, the importance of not taking short cuts and the importance of work equipment being operated by trained workers.","description_napo_film_3":"Napo is involved in a series of short sketches working with chemicals, including those that are irritants, flammable, corrosive, toxic or a danger to the environment.
